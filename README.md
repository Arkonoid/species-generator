# species-generator
A brief program that generates names, morphology, height, and a sound (added later) for fake species.

A concept for a game I'd still like to make one day. This would be part of a system that generated the names, height, morphology and other attributed for alien species.
It would have been paired with a second similar project that generated planets and their attributes. That project was eventually completed using Python but I've since
lost access to it.

The ability to produce a sound for the fake animals was added later as an afterthought to show the process of how I went about creating the systems to my grandparents, but
was never originally intended to be a part of the program.
