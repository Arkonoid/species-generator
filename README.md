# species-generator
A brief program that generates names, morphology, height, and a sound (added later) for fake species.

A concept for a game I'd still like to make one day. This would be part of a system that generated the names, height, morphology and other attributes for alien species. Then, as a debug, it will list all possible combination of names avalible at the bottom. It was made to be very modular and easily expandable, for both more attributes (as demenstrated with the addition of the 'sounds') as well as new options within those attributes to choose from (more name possibilites, morphologies, etc.) Therefore, the scope of this individual
project was very small, as I thought a proof of concept would do just fine, if only to prove to myself how it would be done.

It would have been paired with a second similar project that generated the species' planets and their attributes (planet size, biomes, gravity, orbits, etc.). That project was eventually completed using Python but I've since lost access to it.

The ability to produce a sound for the fake animals was added later as an afterthought to show the process of how I went about creating the systems to my grandparents, but
was never originally intended to be a part of the program.
